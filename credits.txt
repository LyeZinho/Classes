##### Classes Datapack #####

First off, thank YOU for downloading this datapack and supporting this massive endeavour. While it's still in it's infancy, there is so
much more to come, and I'm happy you're here for it!

Next, thank you to CloudWolf (https://www.youtube.com/c/CloudWolfMinecraft) for all of his amazing content. Content that I not only turned to as
I was coding this, but also even used in all of the raycast spells in the pack. I was super impressed with the system he created, and it saved me
SO much time from having to code it myself. And also to TimberForge (https://www.youtube.com/c/TimberForge) for his content which also helped me
so much! (Custom Block Models!)

Third, is a huge thank you to the r/MinecraftCommands community for all the help they offer to others, which I ended up finding when doing searches
on how to solve all the issues I came across, or when asking myself. Huge shoutout to vdvman1 on his help fine tuning the hitbox detection!

Lastly, is a thank you to Mojang for making all of this possible. This size of this project just simply wouldn't be possible with the old command
block system, or all of the systems they have added since. Their incredible hard work does not go unnoticed on that. And for creating this game.
Without it, this wouldn't exist at all.

To all of you, again: thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!
